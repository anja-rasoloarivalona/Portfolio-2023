        "text_2": "Now, a little backstory: I hail from <>Madagascar<>. Back in 2014, I aced my French Baccalaureate with mathematics as my major. After that, I joined <>HEC Montreal<> for a <>Bachelor of Business Administration<>. Finance was my initial choice, but turns out, numbers alone weren't cutting it. That's when I transitioned to combining Finance with <>Information Technology<>. During my final two years, I stumbled upon IT projects from a business perspective, but it was only in my last semester, in 2018, that I took my first programming course. And bam! It hit me like a drumroll of lightning—I'd found my calling, a blend of <>creativity<> and <>problem-solving<> that set my soul on fire. I was up until 3am tackling coding challenges, driven by an inner spark.",
        "text_3": "Reality hit soon after graduation. I needed a job, and getting hired as a junior developer with just one course under my belt was a tall order. So, I became a Customer Manager for a French startup, but deep down, coding was my true love. Cue the <>self-taught<> grind: work all day, code all night.",
        "text_4": "Then 2020 happened—the year the world hit pause, thanks to Covid-19. I lost my job, but I also had family responsibilities. So, during lock down, I doubled down on my efforts. A few months later, I landed my first gig as a developer.",
        "text_5": "My years at <>Bizbishare<> were transformative. I grew, evolved, and became a confident <>Full-Stack developer<>. Armed with this knowledge, I then joined <>mPhase<>, diving into various projects in an <>agile<> environment. Now, I can whip up digital products from scratch to finish, just like I did with the <>NAIA<> platform. To the person who nudged me toward Finance and Information Technology at university—thank you a million times over! You set me on this incredible coding adventure, and I haven't looked back since!"
