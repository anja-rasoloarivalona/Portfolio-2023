Picture this: it had the Herculean task of juggling authentication, subscriptions, data analysis, elasticsearch, payments, client and admin interface – you name it! The catch? If one piece decided to rebel, it sent the entire tower tumbling down like a house of cards. Not exactly a recipe for tech tranquility, right?  In response to this critical issue. the company bid a solemn farewell to the monolithic era, understanding the perils it posed as it's started its journey towards a microservices architecture, piece by piece.",

Our squad consisted of just three developers - one seasoned full-stack pro with three years under their belt, a part-time backend whiz who was juggling university studies, and yours truly, the only React mastermind. We were a young and vibrant team, all hovering around the ripe age of 24.",
                    "text_3": "As time ticked on, I realized that being the sole front-end warrior often meant I was last in line to deliver features. Sometimes, things clicked seamlessly, but there were those hair-raising nights when we burned the midnight oil because a client meeting was looming on the horizon. Oddly enough, I relished the thrill, but I yearned for tranquility too. That's when I made a deliberate move to delve deep into the inner workings of the API that fueled our front-end, crafted using NodeJS and MySQL. By immersing myself in back-end development, I could smoothly connect the dots between the front and back ends, ultimately evolving into a genuine Full-Stack enthusiast. Consequently, come August 2021, we successfully dismantled the final piece of the monolithic puzzle. I extend heartfelt gratitude to my incredible colleagues for their unwavering support on this rollercoaster ride of growth and development."
